## Running Rice for Development

### Project and Database Setup

* Install the latest 5.7.x version of MySQL Community Edition
  * Be sure to remember your root password!
* Clone this repository 
* Change directory to `db/impex/master` in directory where you cloned the repository
* Run the following to ensure that you can connect to your mysql instance
  * ```mvn validate -Pdb,mysql -Dimpex.dba.password=[root password]```
  * if you have no root passwords use `NONE` for the password
  * if this does not work, make sure your MySQL database is up and running and try again
  * if you want to tweak the schema name, username, or password, see [](https://wiki.kuali.org/display/KULRICE/Load+Impex+Data+via+Maven)
* Execute the following from the root of your project:
```mvn clean install -Pdb,mysql -Dimpex.dba.password=[root password]```
* You will now have a mysql database created with the name, username, and password of "RICE"

### Configuration

* Copy the `rice.keystore` file from `rice-middleware/security/rice.keystore` to your `/usr/local/rice` directory (create this directory if it does not exist)
* For Kuali Rice standalone you will need a file at `/usr/local/rice/rice-config.xml` in order to configure the database
* Create the file at that location using the following template:
```
<config>
    <param name="appserver.url">http://localhost:8080</param>
    <param name="app.context.name">rice-standalone</param>
    
    <param name="keystore.file">/usr/local/rice/rice.keystore</param>
    <param name="keystore.alias">rice</param>
    <param name="keystore.password">r1c3pw</param>

    <param name="datasource.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/RICE</param>
    <param name="datasource.username">RICE</param>
    <param name="datasource.password">RICE</param>
    <param name="datasource.driver.name">${datasource.driver.name.MySQL}</param>
    <param name="datasource.pool.minSize">3</param>
    <param name="datasource.pool.maxOpenPreparedStatements">500</param>
    <param name="datasource.platform">${datasource.platform.MySQL}</param>
    <param name="datasource.ojb.platform">MySQL</param>

    <param name="rice.cxf.client.connectionTimeout">0</param>
    <param name="rice.cxf.client.receiveTimeout">20000</param>
    
    <param name="filter.login.class">org.kuali.rice.krad.web.filter.DummyLoginFilter</param>
    <param name="filtermapping.login.1">/*</param>

</config>
```

### Development in Eclipse

* Download and install the latest version of Eclipse for J2EE developers
* Increase the max memory used when launching eclipse from 1024 (the default) to at least 2048.
* Install the Groovy eclipse and m2e connector plugins from the following url in the Eclipse Marketplace: http://dist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.5/
* Disable all validators globally in Eclipse
* Add an Ant property pointing to your Eclipse workspace
  * Eclipse -> Preferences -> Ant -> Runtime -> Properties -> Add Property
  * Set name as "eclipse.workspace" and value as "${workspace_loc}"
* File -> Import.. -> Existing Maven Projects
* Then browse the folder where you cloned the repo and ensure that all of the various pom.xml modules are selected and click "Finish"
* After approximately one year of waiting, the build should complete and hopefully there will be no errors

### Running Rice Standalone in Eclipse

* In the Servers tab, add a new Server (preferably Tomcat 8)
* Drag-and-drop the "rice-standalone" to the new tomcat server in the servers view, this will publish it
* Because of issues with m2e-wtp plugin (maven and web tools integration), the overlays and filtering on the rice-standalone module don't work :( We have created an Ant target in the root of the project that can be run that will deploy the proper files. It is called "m2e-wtp-deploy-standalone", execute that target via Eclipase and it will copy the appropriate files
* Right-click on the server and start it
* Rice Standalone should (hopefully) start up successfully
* Go to http://localhost:8080/rice-standalone and you should see the Kuali Rice "portal"
